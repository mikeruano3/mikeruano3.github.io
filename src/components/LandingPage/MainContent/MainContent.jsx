			<p><i>Please refer to the <NavLink to="/resume">resume section</NavLink> for aditional info!</i></p>

			<p>
				As a Science and Systems Engineer ( aka Computer Science / Software Engineer ) I have manage to
				find my way to learn a lot of the amazing technologies that are available for this field.
				From programming languages, software design, computer asseymbly to software architecture, I've
				built a strong background over which I can apply the knowledge to create complex projects when needed.
        </p>

			<p>
				I've been working with a lot of programming languages throughout my time as a computer engineer.
				I've worked with complex languages such as Assembly or C/C++ and simpler ones, such as Python.
				Right now, my personal favorite is JavaScript as is one of the most powerful and popular languages nowadays.
				I love how easily you can manage data structures and all the shorcuts you can use to make your programming life easier.
				Because a like JavaScript so much, my love for React has been flourishing ever since I discovered it.
        </p>

			<p>
				Currently I'm working on my master's degree for Artifitial Intelligence alongside my DevOps trainning.
        </p>
